Qiskit is an open source software suitable for working with Quantum Computers.

Qiskit is a great tool to start learning Quantum Algorithms and understanding the result of a Classical Computer versus Ideal Quantum Computer or Noisy Quantum Computer.

# Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm

in this algorithm one can see the advantages of Quantum Computers over Classical Computers 

this algorithm aims to make a correct guess about an unknown number 

If the number has n bits 

a Classical Computer would need n trials to find the number 

But, Quantum Computers can find the number just in one shot 

# Repeaters 

In the repeater file you can find the implementation of a Quantum repeater using Qiskit tool with noise
